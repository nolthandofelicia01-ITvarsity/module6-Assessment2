        <p>The Porsche 718 is a series of one- or two-seat sports-racing cars built by Porsche from 1957 to 1962. An open-wheel single-seat model was developed for Formula racing.The 718 was a development of the successful Porsche 550A with improvements made to the body work and suspension. The car's full name is 718 RSK, where "RS" stands for RennSport (sports-racing) and the "K" reflects the shape of the car's revised torsion-bar suspension. It had a mid-engined layout and used the 142 horsepower (106 kW) 1.5-litre Type 547/3 quad-cam engine introduced in the 550A. </p>
        <p>The base engines are gruff, but the handling is as sweet as ever. Very few sports cars are this complete. The badge is new, too. Well, new-ish. Porsche 718 was the name scribed across a series of mid-engined, flat-four racecars that competed in the late Fifties and early Sixties. You can probably forgive the marketing team at Stuttgart for grasping the opportunity to attach it to the newly flat-four Boxster and Cayman, then, but the water somewhat muddies when you learn the 6cyl Cayman GTS and GT4 are now badged 718, too. As before, there are several tiers of Cayman ownership, echoed by the 718 Boxster range, which has gone the same 4cyl route but which is now more expensive than its coupe sibling, better reflecting how rivals price their hard- and soft-top model lines. Naturally the Boxster’s leapfrogged the Cayman’s price, rather than the other, more benevolent way around…</p>
