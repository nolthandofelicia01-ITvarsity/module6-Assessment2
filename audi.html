        <p>With all the buzz surrounding the big-grilled 2021 BMW M4 and M3, itâ€™s easy to forget their Audi Sport rivals, the RS5 Coupe and RS5 Sportback, have recently been facelifted. The visual changes are subtle yet effective. On the outside, the most obvious update is the wider and flatter Singleframe grille, modeled after the latest RS6 Avant and RS7 Sportback models. More subtle details include the refreshed side skirts, front spoiler and rear diffuser, the implied air vents above the grille (a throwback to the 1980s Audi Sport quattro), as well as the updated signatures for the standard Matrix LED headlights and LED taillights.</p>
        <p>Two new colors have been added to the palette (Turbo Blue and Tango Red) and a gloss black styling package is standard. For further differentiation, customers also have the option of aluminum matt and carbon styling package, Audi rings and RS badges in a black design, and a CFRP roof for the RS5 Coupe. Also optional are the 20-inch wheels in gloss black or matte bronze. Inside, changes are mostly focused on the new 10.1-inch MMI touch screen with acoustic feedback, based on the third-generation modular infotainment platform (MIB 3). Optional extras include the 12.3-inch Audi virtual cockpit plus, two new individual RS modes, standard RS sport seats covered in Alcantara and leather (fine Nappa leather available), and the RS design package in red or grey.</p>
