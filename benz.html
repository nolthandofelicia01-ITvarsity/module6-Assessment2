        <p>Measuring 4549mm long, 1796mm wide and 1446mm tall, the A-Class Sedan is 130mm longer and 6mm taller than the hatch, though the 2729mm wheelbase remains the same</p>
        <p>The German marque claims the new small sedan is "at the top of its segment with regard to rear headroom" with its 1024mm/944mm measurements front and rear, while the 420L boot area is 50L more accommodating than the hatchback.n terms of design, the sedan sports the same 'predator' face as the hatch and the larger CLS four-door coupe, though the new rear end is a new look for the brand. Unlike the same-same look worn by the larger C-Class, E-Class and S-Class sedans, the A-Class Sedan gets a unique rear that is more progressive and sporty than its larger stablemates, while the LED tail-light signature gets a dual-element treatment similar to the previous-gen A-Class hatchback.  </p>
