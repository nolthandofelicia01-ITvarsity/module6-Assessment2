        <p>The eagerly-awaited G20-generation BMW 3 Series has been launched in South Africa. The 3 is BMW's bread-and-butter model, which means it was critical for the Bavarian brand to build on the strengths of its business class sedan (as well as address the F30's shortcomings). Does BMW's newcomer now stand well clear of its rivals?</p>
        <p>Following on from the successful F30, the BMW (G20) 3 Series offers 50:50 weight distribution, a lower centre of gravity and a wider front track. Apart from notable mechanical changes, the 3's wheelbase is a tad longer, which benefits interior space, and the newcomer is based on the brand's CLAR platform, which has led to increased body rigidity (torsional stiffness). The design is unmistakably BMW, mostly due to the imposing grille and striking side profile. The look is upmarket and smart, and when adorned with large rims and an eye-catching paint finish, the new 3 looks the part! BMW sold in excess of 15 million units of the G20's predecessors, therefore it's imperative that it continues the 3 Series' tremendous run of form. The German manufacturer is claiming its 8th consecutive year of record sales and is predicting a similar performance for 2019</p>
